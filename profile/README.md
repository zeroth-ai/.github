## 🎯 What is Zeroth?

Zeroth is a modern, UI-heavy open source organization dedicated to creating **magical digital experiences**. We believe that the zeroth impression the moment before the first impression is crucial. It's the preloading animation, the micro-interaction, the subtle detail that makes users stop and think *"wow."*

Our mission is to provide developers and designers with a comprehensive toolkit of beautifully crafted, deeply animated components, powerful development tools, and collaborative platforms that make building stunning interfaces not just possible, but inevitable.
